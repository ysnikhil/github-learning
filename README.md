Learning features of github

## Initialize the git in any repository 
git init

## Check the status of the files which are getting tracked by git or not
git status

## git stage
The stage is a place where the files are saved which we are interested to push for commiting to the repository.
The working directory is the place where all our objects are present. Stage is like adding interested items in the shopping cart and commit is like purchasing the items, which will clean
up the shopping cart. 

## If want to stage all the files in the repo
git add .

## If want to stage only one object at a time.
git add object_name

## If we want to commit the changes in the git
git commit -m "comment"
